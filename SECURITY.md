## Scope

This project is a read-only MCP proxy for the Yandex Metrica API. Key security properties:

- **Token isolation**: the OAuth token is only ever sent to `api-metrika.yandex.net` (SSRF guard in `src/client/http.ts`)
- **No persistence**: no database, no file writes, no caching of credentials
- **No write access**: no tool modifies Yandex Metrica counter data (Logs API lifecycle operations only manage temporary export jobs)
- **Non-root Docker**: container runs as the built-in `node` user
